/*
 * EDID (Extended Display Information Data) parsing, taken from libweston's
 * compositor-drm.c; original author information below.
 *
 * EDID is an extensible binary block provided by monitors to describe their
 * physical capabilities, preferred resolutions, etc. The most common
 * extension to EDID is CEA. There are a multitude of timing formulae used,
 * including GTF (General Timing Formula), which is these days less preferred
 * to CVT (Continuously Variable Timing).
 *
 * The raw EDID block can usually be found in
 * /sys/class/drm/cardN-CONNECTOR-N/edid, as well as through the KMS connector
 * property helpfully named 'EDID'.
 *
 * Parsing EDID can be difficult, and even if you parse it correctly, you are
 * likely to need to apply specific quirks, such as for when the physical size
 * fields instead just contain the panel's aspect ratio:
 * https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2011-October/157671.html
 *
 * This should eventually make its way out into shared source which could be
 * used by all compositors, as well as the kernel. The kernel already parses
 * EDID and makes some decisions based on that, filling out the 'mode' file
 * in sysfs. However, this is not always reliable, and throws away a lot of
 * information.
 *
 * Xorg has probably the most complete EDID parser, which can be found in
 * hw/xfree86/ddc/interpret_edid.c and hw/xfree86/modes/xf86EdidModes.c from
 * https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver
 *
 * The kernel's can be found in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid.c.
